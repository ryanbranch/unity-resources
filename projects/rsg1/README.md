# rsg1

**rsg1** is a set of resources which allow implementation of a wide range of behaviors in Unity while using *only* scripting whenever possible. I am avoiding the "drag-and-drop" style of editing, which is often the straightforward choice for many objectives, in order to avoid placing artificial limitations on the capabilities of the program.

Though this project is not a game (or even a coherent program that can stand alone), my goal is for this code to function as a framework upon which more complete and functional projects can be built.
